## PROBLEM STATEMENT
There is a significant gap in understanding the factors that impact students' academic performance, particularly in African secondary schools.
By analyzing key data points such as student demographics, attendance, and exam scores, we aim to identify patterns that contribute to poor performance and provide strategies for improvement.

## DATA COLLECTION AND STORAGE

####Tools Used for Data Collection
Google Forms: The questionnaire was distributed through Google Forms, which collected responses directly from students and educators.
Google Sheets API: Responses were automatically fetched from Google Sheets, connected to the form, using the Google Sheets API.

####Data Storage
The collected data was stored in relational databases to allow for easy querying and analysis. We explored Google BigQuery for  storage solutions:

Google BigQuery: Used for handling large-scale data due to its scalability and support for complex SQL queries.
